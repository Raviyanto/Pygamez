## SPACE-INVADERS ##

A step up from Goblin-Slayer, this time a more fluid and dynamic approach
to an arcade classic utilizing Object-Oriented Programming. 

I commented out most of the code in order to explain what was going on.

If you are running a newer version of Python you will get a DepreciationError 
after calculation the health bar because it doesn't like floating point numbers.
However this does not affect gameplay. 

Be sure to comment if you find any bugs and I will do my best to update the code!
